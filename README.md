**AUTOMATA FORMAL LANGUAGES AND LOGIC**
This project leverages Python with the PLY (Python Lex-Yacc) library to implement a custom syntax for JavaScript constructs, including arithmetic and comparison operators, string operations, if conditions, arrays, and while loops. Explore the intersection of automata, formal languages, and logic with this implementation, showcasing a powerful tool for syntactic analysis and understanding in the realm of programming languages.

**Features**
1)Custom Syntax: Define and understand a specialized syntax for JavaScript constructs.

2)PLY Integration: Utilize PLY (Lex-Yacc) for lexical analysis and parsing, enhancing the efficiency of syntactic processing.

3)Arithmetic and Comparison: Implement a set of arithmetic and comparison operators to enrich the language's expressiveness.

4)Conditional Statements: Explore if conditions for branching logic within the custom syntax.

5)String Operations: Integrate string operations to extend the capabilities of the language.

6)Arrays and Loops: Define syntax for arrays and while loops, facilitating iterative and structured programming.
